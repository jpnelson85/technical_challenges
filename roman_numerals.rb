# What are Roman Numerals?
# https://www.mathsisfun.com/roman-numerals.html

# Your goal is to write a method/function that converts
# an integer into a string such that the number is represented
# in Roman Numerals in the most efficient way.

# For example, the number 4 could be written as IIII
# but it’s more efficient to use IV since that’s a shorter string.

# Assume no number is greater than 4,000.

# Here are the Roman Numeral equivalents you’ll need to know:

# M=1000
# CM=900
# D=500
# CD=400
# C=100
# XC=90
# L=50
# XL=40
# X=10
# IX=9
# V=5
# IV=4
# I=1
# Example

#     #Ruby
#     to_roman(128)
#     => "CXXVIII"
#     to_roman(2000)
#     => "MM"

#     #JavaScript
#     toRoman(2017)
#     => "MMXVII"
#     toRoman(1999)
#     => "MCMXCIX"
