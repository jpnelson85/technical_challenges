# Instructions
# A palindrome is any number, word, or phrase that reads
# the same forward as it does backward. In this challenge,
# we are going to focus on palindromic numbers. For example,
# 12321 is a palindromic number, whereas 123 is not.

# Write a method/function that starts at 0 and finds
# the first twenty-five numbers where the number plus its
# inverse equals a palindrome that is greater than 1,000.

# 47(number) + 74(inverse) = 121(palindrome)
# Note: This does not meet the greater than 1,000 rule.

# Collect the twenty-five numbers in an array as the return value.
# Be sure to collect the number and not the sum.

# Bonus: Once youâ€™ve found a working solution, see if you can
# create a solution without converting the numbers to strings/arrays.
