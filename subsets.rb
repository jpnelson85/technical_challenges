# Instructions
# In this challenge you are given
# an array of unique integers.
# Your job is to return all the possible
# combinations of unique pairs (2 integers only).
# No duplicate pairs are allowed.

# Below are some examples:

#     #Example 1
#     Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
#     Output: [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 4], [3, 4]]
    
#     #Example 2
#     Input: [54, 77]
#     Output[[54, 77]]
    
#     #Example 3
#     Input: []
#     Output: []

# Possible Extension
# If you successfully complete the challenge above,
# consider refactoring your solution to return
# all possible unique subsets from the original array.
# A subset is any selection of the array,
# and can be between 0 and n elements long,
# where n is the number of items in the original array.

#     #Example 1
#     Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
#     Output: [[],[1],[2],[3],[4],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4],[1,2,3],[1,2,4],[1,3,4],[2,3,4],[1,2,3,4]]
